I'm also interested in uncovering the advantages and challenges of online education, particularly in terms of student engagement and interaction. My goal is to provide a comprehensive view of how online education influences learning outcomes and to offer insights that can guide educators and policymakers in enhancing the quality of online learning experiences.
